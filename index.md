This Repo is a Template for the Raspberry Pi SenseHat for Azure IoT Hub.

## RaspberyPi
Before starting the project, you'll need to purchase a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and the 
[Sense Hat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/) that goes on top. 


Next, it is time to download the [Raspberry Pi Operating System](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).

The image will be placed on a Micro SD card so ensure you have a Micro SD card and a Micro SD Card Reader. 

To run this program, you'll need to ensure that you have the [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) on your Raspberry Pi.


You can also run this script built by Microsoft to download the .NET SDK.
